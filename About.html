      My name is Yash Chatniwala, and I am an aspiring Data Analyst with a strong interest in transforming data into meaningful business insights. I come from a commerce background, which gives me a solid understanding of business operations, financial concepts, and decision-making processes alongside technical analysis.</section>
      <section style="--i:2">I have hands-on experience working with Python, SQL, Power BI, and Tableau for data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, data visualization, and predictive modeling. Through academic and personal projects, I have applied statistical techniques and machine learning models to analyze datasets and support data-driven decisions.</section>
      <section style="--i:3">
        I enjoy continuously learning new skills, and as part of this mindset, I am also learning front-end web development (HTML and CSS) to better present my analytical work through interactive dashboards and portfolio projects. I believe strong analysis combined with clear presentation leads to greater business impact.
      </section>
      <section style="--i:4">I am detail-oriented, analytical, and focused on delivering insights that are both accurate and actionable. I am currently seeking opportunities where I can apply my data analytics skills to real-world problems, contribute value through data, and continue growing as a data professional.</section>
